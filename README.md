# Dependabot Core

Dependabot Core is a collection of helper classes for automating dependency
updating in Ruby, JavaScript, Python and PHP. It can also update git submodules
and Docker files. Highlights include:

- Logic to check for the latest version of a dependency *that's resolvable given
  a project's other dependencies*. That means tapping into the package manager's
  dependency resolution logic
- Logic to generate updated manifest and lockfiles for a new dependency version
- Logic to find changelogs, release notes, and commits for a dependency update

Dependabot Core is used by [Dependabot][dependabot].

## Setup

To run Dependabot Core, you'll need Ruby, Python, PHP and Node installed. The
main library is written in Ruby, while JavaScript, Python and PHP are required
for dealing with updates for their respective languages.

Before running Dependabot Core, install dependencies for the core library and
the helpers:

1. `bundle install`
2. `cd helpers/javascript && yarn install && cd -`
3. `cd helpers/php && composer install && cd -`
4. `cd helpers/python && pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Internals

Dependabot Core has helper classes for seven concerns. Where relevant, each
concern will have a language-specific class.

| Service                          | Description                                                                                   |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Dependabot::FileFetchers`       | Fetches the relevant dependency files for a project (e.g., the `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock`). See the [file fetchers](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/tree/master/lib/dependabot/file_fetchers) for more details. |
| `Dependabot::FileParsers`        | Parses a dependency file and extracts a list of dependencies for a project. See the [file parsers](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/tree/master/lib/dependabot/file_parsers) for more details. |
| `Dependabot::UpdateCheckers`     | Checks whether a given dependency is up-to-date. See the [update checkers](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/tree/master/lib/dependabot/update_checkers) for more details. |
| `Dependabot::FileUpdaters`       | Updates a dependency file to use the latest version of a given dependency. See the [file updaters](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/tree/master/lib/dependabot/file_updaters) for more details. |
| `Dependabot::MetadataFinders`    | Looks up metadata about a dependency, such as its GitHub URL. See the [metadata finders](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/tree/master/lib/dependabot/metadata_finders) for more details. |
| `Dependabot::PullRequestCreator` | Creates a Pull Request to the original repo with the updated dependency file.                 |
| `Dependabot::PullRequestUpdater` | Updates an existing Pull Request with new dependency files (e.g., to resolve conflicts).      |

## Why is this open source?

As the name suggests, Dependabot Core is the core of Dependabot (the rest of the
app is pretty much just a UI and database). If we were paranoid about someone
stealing our business then we'd be keeping it under lock and key.

Dependabot Core is open source because we're more interested in it having an
impact than we are in making a buck from it. We'd love you to use
[Dependabot][dependabot], so that we can continue to develop it, but if you want
to build and host your own version then this library should make doing so a
*lot* easier.

If you use Dependabot Core then we'd love to hear what you build!

## History

Dependabot and Dependabot Core started life as [Bump][bump] and
[Bump Core][bump-core], back when Harry and Grey were working at
[GoCardless][gocardless]. We remain grateful for the help and support of
GoCardless in helping make Dependabot possible - if you need to collect
recurring payments from Europe, check them out.

## Contributing

We'd love to see the following improvements to Dependabot Core:

- Support for [npm5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm5) in JavaScript
- Support for Python's upcoming [Pipfile](https://github.com/pypa/pipfile)
- Support for additional languages (Elixir, anyone?)
